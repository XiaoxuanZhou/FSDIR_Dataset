# Multi-Scene Infrared Remote Sensing Dataset

## ðŸ“– Introduction
This dataset contains **A Multi-Target Dynamic Infrared Remote Sensing Dataset Fusing Remote Sensing Data and Physical Modeling*, with a total size of about **150 GB**.  
It is mainly designed for:  
- Detection and tracking of aircraft/ship targets in dynamic scenes  

- Each scene is stored in a `.rar` archive for easy download and management.  
- The dataset has been permanently archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/uploads/17213990) and [BaiduNetdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11fGqpjKCtvAi3j83nN2hsw) DIRD, and is assigned a DOI for citation.
